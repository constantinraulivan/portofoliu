# Web Portofolio

This is a web application that represents my web portfolio. Here, you will find more information about both myself (**Including reviews from my past employers**) and my professional background.

Additionally, you will find links to some of my personal projects, created both within specialized courses and to practice my programming skills.

# Main functionalities

I wanted my presentation website to be a project in itself, so I tried to incorporate as many features as you find in most online websites:

- It is mobile-friendly.
- I aimed to create a unique design that reflects my personal style.
- Dynamic carousel.
- The Navigation Bar is Sticky.
- I created a tabbed component with information about the courses I have taken.
- Pop-up triggered by clicking the 'Contact me' button.
- Dark Mode.
- etc.

I want to emphasize that all these elements were built using pure JavaScript, without the use of any libraries like Bootstrap."


# The purpose of the application in the learning process

This application has helped me practically consolidate the vast majority of all the information learned in courses and tutorials.

Moreover, I believe that regardless of the field of activity, presenting your projects is just as important as their quality.
